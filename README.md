## About...

Hello,

This is a port of Cyanogen's lge-kernel-gproj for one and only - LG 
Optimus G Pro. It supports all E98x variants, and I don't have a plan 
to support F240x variants for sake of reasons - first of all, I don't 
have that device, second - I don't know anything about it, so far it 
was proven that F240x is different for more than modem.

Currenlty supported Android version is 4.4, which mean all CM11.0 
based ROMs will support it. I myself I'm using it on PAC 4.4.
